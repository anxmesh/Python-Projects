# Workout Tracker 🏋🏻
Workout Tracker built using the <a href="https://pixe.la"> Pixela API</a>.
## How it Works ⚙️ 
Using the pixela APi and http requests built into python, a graph is created to track your workouts. 
Everyday, the user can make the entries onto this program, and then view their graph/tracker on pixela.
