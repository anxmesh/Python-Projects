# Flashy: The Flash Card app ⚡️
Flash card app designed to help learn the French language 🇫🇷 (Language can be changed by changing the dictionary 
csv included)
## How it works ⚙️
The program contains a csv that holds within it the 100 most commonly used words in the French language (as of 2018).
A flash card showing French words appears upon starting this program; the program gives the user 3 seconds to try and 
recall the translatoin before the card flips over and reveals it. 
### The ✅ Button
If the word, and it's translation, are known to the user, clicking on this button will generate a new csv that contains
all the words in the original pool minus the ones known to the user, thereby removing the chance of running into the 
same words time and again.
### The ❌ Button
If the word is not known to the user, clicking on this button sends it back into the pool of words and a new word is 
displayed. The word discarded may show up again at a later point.
## Resources 📦
### Data Folder 💿
Contains the csv file holding the words to be learnt and their translations, and the words left to learn once the 
program has been run atleast once.
### Images 🎑
Contains the elements of the flashcard app such as the front and back of the card, and the button images.
